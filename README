# AquaSense: Groundwater Level Prediction for Sustainable Agriculture

## Overview

AquaSense is an innovative iOS application designed to empower small and medium-sized farmers in France with advanced groundwater level predictions and agricultural insights. Leveraging machine learning and comprehensive data analysis, the app helps farmers make informed decisions about crop selection and water management in the face of increasing climate challenges.

## Problem Statement

Climate change is significantly impacting agricultural water resources in France:
- 36-40% of agricultural water needs come from groundwater
- Increasing drought conditions threaten agricultural sustainability
- Farmers lack reliable tools to predict water availability and optimize crop selection

## Key Features

### 1. Groundwater Prediction
- Real-time groundwater level predictions based on:
  - Farmer's specific location
  - Integrated weather API data
  - Machine learning predictive modeling

### 2. Crop Profit Analysis
- Comprehensive crop recommendation system
- Calculates:
  - Hardiness zone assessment
  - Additional water requirements
  - Water cost projections
  - Seed and growing expenses
- Provides clear, actionable recommendations for most profitable crops

## Technical Architecture

- Machine Learning Model
- Weather API Integration
- Crop Database Management
- User-Friendly Interface

## Groundwater Prediction Model

### Dataset
Our groundwater prediction model is trained on a comprehensive French piezometric stations dataset containing:
- Data from thousands of monitoring stations across France
- Over 3 million historical measurements from 2020-2023
- Key measurements include:
  - Groundwater level readings
  - Station locations (longitude/latitude)
  - Measurement depths
  - Department and commune information
  - Detailed hydrogeological data

This robust dataset enables accurate groundwater level predictions, particularly during critical summer months when water management is most crucial.

### Weather API
We are evaluating weather APIs that provide:
- Historical weather data
- Current conditions
- Weather forecasts
- Precipitation data
This data will integrate into our groundwater prediction model.

## Crop Data Integration

### Crop Data API
We utilize the Perenual API ([perenual.com](https://perenual.com)), which provides comprehensive plant data, including:
- Watering needs
- Hardiness zone compatibility
- Growth requirements
- Seasonal information

This data helps us determine crop suitability and water requirements for different locations.

### Farmer Location Processing
The system processes the farmer's input seamlessly:
- Farmers only need to input their location
- The system determines plant hardiness zones based on coordinates (API for France pending development)
- Automatically retrieves relevant groundwater and crop data

### Technical Implementation
We have created a custom API that:
1. Receives the farmer’s location input
2. Retrieves weather data and groundwater predictions
3. Queries the Perenual API for suitable crops based on the hardiness zone
4. Integrates this information into our analysis model
5. Returns comprehensive predictions including:
   - Expected groundwater levels
   - Suitable crop recommendations
   - Predicted additional water costs
